          <p>
            I am a student web developer in the process of completing a Udemy
            web development bootcamp. Having worked in customer service for many
            years and feeling as though I have never met my full potential, I
            have dedicated myself to learning a new profession in order to
            pursue my true passions in gaming, development, design and more.

    <h3>Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><input type="checkbox" checked />To create my first website</li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" />Learn HTML</li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" />Learn CSS</li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" />Learn Bootstrap</li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" />Learn Javascript</li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" />Complete Boss Level One</li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" />Earn £3000 pound a month. It's a reasonable
        goal and you could be earning so much more. Visualise earning
        <b>£5000</b> a month going to work. Yes it will be difficult. Yes it
        will take a lot of time, effort and studying to reach that goal. But the
        reality is. It will change not only your life, but the life of your
        family for the better. You can look after those you care about and
        yourself. You can do charity work and save many lives. You can have more
        time and freedom and independence.
        <strong
          >No more call centres! No more Book-keeping! No more
          care-work!</strong
        >
        You will be designing and building websites for individuals and
        companies, constantly gaining knowledge and improving at your skills.
        You will be increasing your earnings year by year and having more time
        to yourself for the important things in life. Inshallah.
