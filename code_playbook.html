  This playbook is an interactive revision manual. A place for me to
  independently practice my code and create a guide containing all of the
  knowledge I have learned. I will be constantly updating it as I progress,
  adding // new features and content as I learn. It is a playground for me to
  experiment while reinforcing past knowledge.
