<h2>HTML.</h2>
<p>The title text is written within the element h2. h2(header2) requires an opening
tag and a closing tag to function and can be used multiple times from h1 to h6,
getting smaller each time. <br />
The line break (br) is a self closing tag that doesn't require a closing tag.
<br />
The line at the top of the page (hr) is a horizontal rule that creates a
straight line. It is thicker and filled in as it was given what's known as an
ATTRIBUTE, in this case, size.h2 <br />

<h2>Creating a website</h2>
When creating a website using vsCode, we begin by using a BOILERPLATE, which is
a default template that simplifies the initial process of setting up a HTML site
by outputting a pre-set code designed for HTML5. Everything written in between
the html opening and closing tag is part of the html site. <br />
Inside the HTML code, I can see it consists of a head and a body. The head,
actually stores information about the webpage (such as a title) and that tells
the browser how the page is to be handled. <br />
A line can be seen beginning with meta in the head of the html boilerplate.
<br />
This line is the meta_element and provides associated data (metadata) to the
HTML document. For example: <br />
The char set attribute UTF 8, tells the browser that all the characters within
the html document are encoded using UTF8.<br />
Characters used that UTF can't encode cause MOJIBAKE, where the computer will
print a bunch of random symbols(gibberish). For example, trying to use arabic
characters in UTF 8 will not be compatible.<br />
The meta section is also where the description that will appear in search
engines is written. <br /> </p> 

<h2>Formatting and structuring</h2>
<p>ul - This stands for unstructured list.  This creates a list of bullet points with no particular order.</p>
<p>ol - This stands for organised list.  This creates a list of numbers in numerical order.  This can be edited to roman numerals/different starting number etc. via attributes. </p>
<p>table - This creates a table of which provides better structure.
    tr creates a row while td creates a data cell within the row (essentially functioning as the columns, more td = more columns.
        thead creates a header for the table.  Creating a header allows the header to be isolated from the rest of the table to allow programmable feautures such as scrolling.
            th can create header cells within the thead.
            Tables can be nested, meaning tables can be created inside tables to allow for more advanced structures.
